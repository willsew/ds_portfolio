## Overview

This project investigates the relationship between Spotifyâ€™s **audio features** and **track popularity**, focusing on the feature **danceability**.  
Using a dataset of over **30,000 songs** from the [Kaggle Spotify Songs dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/30000-spotify-songs/data), we explore whether danceable tracks tend to be more popular.

The project employs **regression models** to quantify associations, evaluates model assumptions, and provides visual insights into how audio characteristics drive listener engagement.
