**[NBA 3-Point Attempt Rate and Shooting Efficiency Analysis](https://github.com/willsew/ds_portfolio/tree/main/personal_projects/nba-3par-efficiency-analysis)**  
Analyzes 2023â€“24 NBA player data to reveal a U-shaped relationship between three-point attempt rate (3PAr) and shooting efficiency (eFG%), showing that players are most efficient when they specialize as interior finishers or high-volume three-point shooters.
