## Overview

https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/fungi-clef-2025

This project explores whether **environmental metadata** (e.g., elevation, habitat, and region) can enhance the performance of **fungal image classification models**.
Automated fungi classification systems must overcome:
- Limited labeled data  
- High visual similarity between species  
- Strong **class imbalance** across taxonomic classes  

We compare a baseline **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on image data alone to a **multi-input neural network** that combines image and metadata features.

## Research Question

> Can the inclusion of metadata (e.g., elevation, habitat) enhance model performance in classifying fungal taxonomic class compared to a model using only image data?
